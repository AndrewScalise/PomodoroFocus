# Vercel Deployment Instructions

This document provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the Pomodoro Timer app to Vercel.

## Prerequisites

1. Create a Vercel account if you don't have one already
2. Install the Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
3. Make sure all the changes outlined in this guide have been applied to your project

## Deployment Steps

1. **Login to Vercel CLI**
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

2. **Initialize Vercel in your project**
   ```bash
   vercel init
   ```

3. **Deploy to Vercel**
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

4. Follow the prompts in the CLI to complete the deployment process.

## Project Structure Notes

The project has been adapted to work with Vercel's serverless architecture:

1. **API Routes**: All API endpoints are now implemented as Vercel Serverless Functions in the `/api` directory.

2. **Storage Adapters**: The application uses an in-memory storage implementation for both local development and serverless environments.

3. **Vercel Configuration**: The `vercel.json` file sets up routing for the application:
   - API routes are directed to the corresponding serverless functions
   - All other routes are served the SPA frontend

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during deployment:

1. Check the Vercel build logs for errors
2. Ensure that all necessary files are committed to your repository
3. Verify that the build command and output directory are correctly configured in vercel.json
4. Check that the API routes are properly defined in the `/api` directory
5. Make sure environment variables are set correctly in the Vercel dashboard

## Next Steps for Production

For a production deployment, consider:

1. Implementing a persistent database solution (Postgres, MongoDB, etc.)
2. Setting up environment variables for configuration
3. Implementing authentication for user-specific data
4. Adding error monitoring and logging services
